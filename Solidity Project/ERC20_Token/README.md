# ERC20 Token on Ethereum

ðŸš€ Designed, developed, and deployed a fully functional ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity.

The token implements all standard ERC20 functions, including:
- `transfer`
- `approve`
- `transferFrom`
- `balanceOf`

These functions enable secure and efficient token transfers between accounts and ensure compatibility with wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications (DApps) across the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Full ERC20 Compliance**  
  Implements the official ERC20 standard to guarantee seamless integration with existing blockchain infrastructure.

- **Secure Transactions**  
  Built with security best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities and ensure safe token operations.

- **Allowance & Approval Mechanisms**  
  Supports delegated transactions, allowing third-party smart contracts or users to transfer tokens on behalf of others.

- **Seamless Integration**  
  Designed for easy adoption by DeFi protocols, marketplaces, and other blockchain applications.
