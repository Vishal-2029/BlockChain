# Lottery Contract

ðŸ‘‰ **Hello Everyone âœ¨**

In this project, I developed a lottery smart contract using the Solidity programming language.

ðŸš€ Check out my latest Solidity project: **A Lottery Contract**.

I'm thrilled to share my first project where I created a lottery contract from scratch using Solidity.

## How It Works

- A minimum of **3 participants** is required to start the lottery.
- Each participant must send **1 Ether** to join.
- Once the minimum number of participants is reached, the contract owner can trigger the selection of a **random winner**.
- The winner receives the total Ether collected in the lottery pool.
- The contract owner can manage the contractâ€™s balance and reset the lottery for a new round.

## Key Features

- **Minimum Participants Rule** â€” Ensures fair play by requiring at least 3 participants.
- **Fixed Entry Fee** â€” Standardized entry fee of 1 Ether for all players.
- **Random Winner Selection** â€” Pseudo-random algorithm to choose a winner.
- **Balance Management** â€” Contract keeps track of collected funds and distributes them securely.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain:** Ethereum  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity  
- **Wallet Integration:** MetaMask or similar
